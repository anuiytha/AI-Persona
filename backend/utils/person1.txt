Imagine your 15 years full of dreams and you told you can't chase them because of a disability that was me science was my passion but a well-meaning lecturer steered me to towards something easier it stung but it didn't break me it ignited a fire within me this is a journey of that child to become a Serial social antrepreneur who is standing in front of you today but my path was not paved with roses it was filled with rejections rejections that could have stopped me in my tracks it here I am today before you ready to share my story of resilience ladies and gentlemen I am Malika Juna AA and today I invite you to embark on a journey of reflection courage and resilience with me a journey filled with barriers but one that is undeniably worth living a 15-year-old me passionate about science only to be told that my disability would hinder my Pursuit the disappointment was palpable but instead of letting it Define me I choose to fight back fast forward to my university years where rejection knocked on my doors despite being among the top students I was deemed unfit for research but I didn't let that setback deter me instead I turned it into an opportunity winning a pivotal student election that opened up many doors that I never imagined these rejections taught me three invaluable lessons pain can be transformed into pleasure challenges into opportunities and passion into a mission life with all its complexities offers moments of pure goodness waiting to be discovered and cherished am Miss trials and tribulations these good things serve as pillars of happiness fulfillment and contentment through my experiences I have come to understand the essence of these good things and I'm here to share them with you through three learnings two framework and one Mission 32 1 my first learning graduate from a taker to a giver at 15 rejection taught me the importance of perseverance denied the opportunity to pursue science due to my my disability I refus to accept defeat instead I embraced my passion and refused to let limitations Define me similarly at 22 in University rejection fueled my resolve pushing me to a stand for student election and ultimately collaborate on a groundbreaking initiatives transitioning from a taker to a giver was a transformative Journey one that required a shift in mindset and also priorities a sloka in Sanskrit reminded me the essence of giving to become a generous person it goes like this through giving renunciation sacrifice time and Purity I learn to focus on what I could offer others rather than dwell on my limitations this shift not only propelled my personal growth but also enrich the life those around me I an a mission to empower 5,000 persons with disabilities though and giving 10,000 job opportunities through them changing The Narrative of the disability Community as a giver and contributors which once considered takers these entrepreneurs with disabilities are going to contribute in Indian economy being inclusive in building viasit bat let me introduce you my first framework which I rigorously follow social role valorization SRV SRV aims to enhance the societal value of marginalized individuals shifting them from Mere recipients to active contributors by recognizing inherent value promoting not promoting social integration and challenging prevailing Norms SRV empowers individuals to find the purpose and belonging within their Community through these personal experiences I learned the importance of shifting from a mindset of passivity or entitlement to one of active contribution and generosity overall rejections can serve as powerful Catalyst for personal transformation leading individuals to embrace a mindset of giving and service the shift not only benefits others but also brings deep satisfaction and fulfillment to The Giver my second learning your ecosystem is your netw worth am Miss rejection I realized the power of community lacking platforms for individuals with disabilities I founded the physically challenged people's Forum way back in 1998 creating a support system for aspiring students like me from these humble beginnings the first non not for-profit organization was born in the year 2000 at the same University which has denied uh and which felt that I was not capable enough to do a world- class research we started building inclusive campus with unlimited opportunities for persons with disabilities our journey did not end there it merely marked the beginning of a more significant Mission building India's first first of its kind inclusive ecosystem for persons with disabilities in 2019 just before Co let me share a personal incident which led to this my father who is a great mentor and guide to me always challenged me before accepting my point of view one such occasion where I was proudly sharing about my friends wellwishers and mentors from swadeshi movement F trade movement where I spent more than 15 years of my precious professional life he posed a direct question do you think your network of circles support you when you required confidently I said yes he wanted me to prove it he gave a challenge to raise shortterm interest field money to buy a house in Hyderabad that to 50% of it should come from these circles and rest of the 50% should be a bank loan no family member should be involved in this that was a challenge these theories and Frameworks sometimes put you in a spot he's basically asking for proof of concept for the first time I had drawn my ecosystem and shakeh holders on paper divided them into five circles innermost being the family second one friend third one being your internal and external team members fourth circle being your vendors and suppliers and the fifth Circle the highet individuals and the companies who can really render you an interest free loan for shortterm this were the a lifechanging moment for me if I fail to raise money my decision to remain in the development sector will be questioned using my second framework the theory of change I learned that by nurturing relationships fostering collaboration and embracing diversity we can cultivate a robust Network that propels us toward our goal my theory of change proved right my ecosystem responded and in a week's time at received 3 million Indian rupees from eight stakeholders of the ecosystem this led me to establish India's first inclusive ecosystem and within 4 years time around thousand plus entrepreneurs with disabilities are incubated to set up micro Enterprises my third

there is an African author who wrote a book title of the book is Inspire before you expire that's the title of the book very interesting to read so when I met him he told few things what motivated him to write this book he says that if we find purpose of life at the earliest possible that is where no we can live the life so most of us would be wasting most of the time in other things and maybe after 15-20 years will understand what to do with this life and then we'll start the journey but if we know pretty young what needs to be done with this life I think that is where the entire magic will happen I never imagined that a competition can also build some competencies while organizing the competition itself is something very unique starting from nepi yantra should be the mantra for innovation foreign.
